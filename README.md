# UPDATE
As of today ( 21st of January 2025 ) this specific method of sending files above 10MB has been patched. <br>
New file size limit for webhooks is ~ 9MB.  <br>








# Hook25MB
A very simple website that lets you upload files to webhook that are up to 25MB.

**EDIT (11th of January 2025)**: Small fix, re-style and now you can also write something along the attachment.
